# Todo by ChatGPT

This was created by ChatGPT because I was bored, majority of the code/troubleshooting/features were explained to ChatGPT and then implemented by me

- Majority of the code is written by ChatGPT with some minor tweaks to make the code functional with the rest of it.

# Documentation
Creating your own build using PyInstaller -
```
pip install PyInstaller
```
```
pyinstaller <filename.py> -F
```
***-F refers to onefile, --onefile can also be used.***

Installing the requirements -
```
Currently there are only two requirements that may require installing.

pip install coloured
pip install discord_webhook //this one isn't really used, if you want to implement webhooks into this check the top of the source and the add_todo() function
```
